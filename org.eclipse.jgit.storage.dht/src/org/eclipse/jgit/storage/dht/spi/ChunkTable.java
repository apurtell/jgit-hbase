/**
 * Stores object data in compressed pack format.
 * <p>
 * Each chunk stores multiple objects, using the highly compressed and Git
 * native pack file format. Chunks are sized during insertion, but average
 * around 1 MB for historical chunks, and may be as small as a few KB for very
 * recent chunks that were written in small bursts.
 * <p>
 * Objects whose compressed form is too large to fit into a single chunk are
 * fragmented across multiple chunks, and the fragment information is used to
 * put them back together in the correct order. Since the fragmenting occurs
 * after data compression, random access to bytes of the large object is not
 * currently possible.
 * <p>
 * Chunk keys are very well distributed, by embedding a uniformly random number
 * at the start of the key, and also including a small time component. This
 * layout permits chunks to be evenly spread across a cluster of disks or
 * servers in a round-robin fashion (based on a hash of the leading bytes), but
 * also offers some chance for older chunks to be located near each other and
 * have that part of the storage system see less activity over time.
