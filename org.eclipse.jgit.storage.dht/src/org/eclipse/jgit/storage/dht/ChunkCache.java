/**
 * Caches recently used {@link PackChunk} in memory for faster read access.
 * <p>
 * During a miss, older entries are evicted from the cache so long as
 * {@link #isFull()} returns true.
 * <p>
 * Its too expensive during object access to be 100% accurate with a least
 * recently used (LRU) algorithm. Strictly ordering every read is a lot of
 * overhead that typically doesn't yield a corresponding benefit to the
 * application.
 * <p>
 * This cache implements a loose LRU policy by randomly picking a window
 * comprised of roughly 10% of the cache, and evicting the oldest accessed entry
 * within that window.
 * <p>
 * Entities created by the cache are held under SoftReferences, permitting the
 * Java runtime's garbage collector to evict entries when heap memory gets low.
 * Most JREs implement a loose least recently used algorithm for this eviction.
 * <p>
 * The internal hash table does not expand at runtime, instead it is fixed in
 * size at cache creation time. The internal lock table used to gate load
 * invocations is also fixed in size.
 * <p>
 * To maintain higher concurrency workloads, during eviction only one thread
 * performs the eviction work, while other threads can continue to insert new
 * objects in parallel. This means that the cache can be temporarily over limit,
 * especially if the nominated eviction thread is being starved relative to the
 * other threads.
